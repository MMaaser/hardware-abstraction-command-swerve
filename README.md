# CTRE Generated Swerve Code with Maple-Sim

Another practice for me. Hopefully I'll be able to implement vision simulation, but my main goal is fully simulating swerve. 

Things I've picked up:
- git has a limit to file and repo size
- for some reason, it factors branch history into that
- gitignore is a good way to leave out compiled folders because they're practically useless to anyone besides you and the clog up your repo
